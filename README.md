### Hi I'm Frederik Kristensen 👋

- ⌨️ I am learning web development. I have jumped around alot between programming fields, so my intetion is to focus down on React and its ecosystem for now. While I can jump around in fields, I now aim to get a good understanding in one field. My intetion with focusing on one field is to break in to the job market. While I still have the value of being flexiable as a programmer. Under here is some examples of work I have done.
    - Azure database(SQL).
    - Scripted a IT support tool that reinstalled printers (Powershell).
    - Temperature scanner with raspberry pies (Python).
    - Took the temperature scannings from the pie send it to our a API we made (C#).
    - Web app that took the data from our API and displayed it (Vue.js).
    - Minor projects (C#) with UIs (Htmx).
